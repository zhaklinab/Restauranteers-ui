# Restauranteers-ui
This is a homework project for Software engineering in Polytechnic University of Tirana. 
We are a group of three students working on this project. 
Our idea was to make a network of Restaurants. 
People can use this kind of network to search restaurants, can see their menus and rate restaurants.
For the design we have been using a bootstrap theme (Yeti) and everything was build basing on bootstrap libraries.  
Enjoy! :)
